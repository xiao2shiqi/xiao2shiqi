I am a full-stack engineer focused on building practical products and clean developer workflows.
I enjoy backend architecture with Java and modern frontend development with JavaScript/TypeScript and Vue.
Recently, I have been exploring AI-powered applications and shipping ideas quickly from prototype to production.
I am also building an English learning platform: [nce.xiao27.com](https://nce.xiao27.com/).
I write about engineering and product building at [blog.xiao27.com/en](https://blog.xiao27.com/en/).
